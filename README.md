# TranzAct -- the mobile app

## Purpose

- This application serves as a mobile app for anyone looking to automate light to medium CSV/Data calculations. 


## Features


### Safety and Security first

- In 2021, most people above the age of 10 understand the vulnerability of data on web applications, yet businesses and organizations either attempt to hide the vulnerabilites or completely ignore them, hoping their users won't notice. This app attempts to solve that issue. How?...

- When a user first registers they reigster with minimal information; an email and password. This applicaiton uses the most recent and stable versions of `Ruby` and `Rails` to validate a secure password, and encrypt it so the developers never have access to it.

- Another feature of this app is once one is ready to import and calculate items using a CSV file, they can do so without saving the CSV file to any database. You can rest assured that, if you use this method of importing, your information will not be kept on the application in any way. One also has the choice of saving a CSV file to their profile, but it is reccomended that if one chooses to save a CSV file to their profile that they do it with non-sensative information. 

### Calculate the most import information, quickly

- The main purpose of this app is to allow users to import CSV files in order to make quick calculations that might otherwise take a more involved program. One can easily import a CSV file from their mobile device and calculate various numbers like; average price per item, number of customers, number of customers in a specific city and/or state, etc.
